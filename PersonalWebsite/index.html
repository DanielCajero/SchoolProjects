        <h1></br>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am currently taking a coding bootcamp at Los Angeles City College (LACC). The bootcamp name is Hi-Tech Los Angeles Coding Bootcamp. I have taken some classes at LACC that have taught me programming logic and language.</p>
        <p>What I love about coding is that feeling of learning something new. As you learn something thing, you become more proficient at it. I believe that coding gives me that feeling more often.</p>
        <p>As a kid I always want to be many things: chef, artist, inventor, computers, and leader of my own country. Many of these dreams were thrown out the window as time passed by. Chef, I don't have a great sense of smell - out. Artist, wow, you work so hard and in a good year, you may hit 50k, too risky. The leader of my country, also too risky. By the end of high school, I gave myself two options computers or mechanical engineer. Because I had a more defined idea of what I would do as a mechanical engineer. I choose engineering. I was going to school to get a BS Mechanical Engineering. I wasn't doing so well when it came to my math classes. Everything else okay. The problem I wasn't into it. I would procrastinate hard. I would mess with my computer, play with Lua and some programs. I was until about the beginning of this year I realized I want to be a programmer and switched majors.</p>
        <p>I was always into computers. They were fascinating at a young age. I remember spending lots of time in messing with several programs here and there. I learned the histories of windows, mac os, and Unix even though it was dead. I looked up was to make my white tower computer running Windows XP on 20 GB harddrive and 2 GB ram. It was terrible. I found out about two things everything was written using code and Linux.</p>
        <p>I decided to try out Linux. The most popular at the time was Ubuntu, Ubuntu 10.10. I remember my first time trying to burn an iso on to a cd instead of iso to a cd using my friend's laptop. It took me 4 tries, 3 with an iso file on it, and one that was an actual image - fun times. I got it running and loved it. I thought I was 1337 as hell for using the terminal sometimes - literally 10 ten times. I only go to use the next two release until my white tower died. After that, I got an all-in-one with Windows 7.</p>
        <p>This is when I got into coding. I saw that I could build a website using HTML. Maybe automate homework calculation easier with python. But, my skills never went far because even though I knew some syntax I could never really understand some words. I have gotten more into programming now because I took some logic and design classes explain most parts of a program. I understand more. I went to learn C++ and be able to use it efficiently learn logic.</p>
        <p>Now you might want to know why Linux? Well, the all-in-one about three years ago. Luckily, I had been saving money to build a PC which I have had for 2 years. It had window 8.1, now window 10. I also bought a laptop which also had windows 10. It sucked up a lot of bandwidth. I only had about 900 Kbps. I remembered Ubuntu doesn't eat bandwidth whenever it feels like it. I decided that to find out the best beginner distro which was Linux Mint. I installed Linux Mint 18 on my laptop.</p>
        <p>Linux Mint has been on my laptop for a while I still just a beginner. I want to use Linux to highest potential possible.</p>
