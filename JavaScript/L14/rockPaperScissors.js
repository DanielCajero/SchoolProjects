Rock, paper, scissors!

Write a rock paper scissors game. 

Part 1:
Take input from player 1 and player 2.

Write a function that takes two values, one for player 1 and the second for player 2. The function will 
return the winner.

Recall:
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock
Rock beats scissors

Examples:

rps('scissors', 'paper') // return 'Player 1 won!'
rps('scissors', 'rock') // return 'Player 2 won!'
rps('paper', 'paper') // return 'Draw!'


Part 2: Modify your program to have player 2 as the computer. Randomly generate their move.
